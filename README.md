# Build an AI Agent with Django, LangGraph, and Permit.

Django has the data. LangGraph coordinates the AI Agents. Permit gives us the guardrails to ensure data is safe.

Build AI Agents with Django, LangGraph, and Permit so you can:

✅ Save user-data with minimal overhead.

✅ Talk to the data you or your users care about.

✅ Integrate third-party rest API services.

✅ Turn any Python functions into tools an Ai Agent can run with queries like 'what are my recent documents?' or 'What new movies are out?'

✅ Chat with Django User data through standard Django queries and without the need for vector embeddings (although you *can* use them).

✅ Easily switch LLMs to upgrade the effectiveness of your agents.

✅ Leverage RBAC (role-based access control) within any Django or Python project.

✅ Create a Super(visor) Agent that controls other agents.

✅ Lock down access to what a User can or cannot do.

✅ Add guardrails to ensure an Agent can't do anything it shouldn't (e.g. create, update, read, search, list, share, or delete any data)

✅ and more.
